# AORTA : Arpasing Oto Reorderer Tool Application

*seperates different phoneme combinations to make setting values and general otoing easier*

so far made entirely by my friend psychic digit.

## usage
- download either the aorta_nogui or aorta_gui zip file and extract it

  - If using the nogui version, follow these instructions
    - create a new folder called "oto_split" in the same directory that the .exe file is in 
    - place an oto.ini file into the directory and run the .exe file
    - follow the prompt and look into "oto_split" to see the created files

  - If using the gui version, follow these instructions
    - Run the .exe file
    - Specify the path of the oto.ini file and output folder
    - Click the "Start Program" button
    - Wait for the status bar to say "Program complete, you may now close the window"
    - Click the "Exit" button
    - Check the output folder you selected previously to see the created files

then you are free to edit the parameters as you need, then place back into a singular oto.ini file using ctrl-c and ctrl-v
